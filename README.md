# Angular Architecture

This is the code repository for the Angular Architecture book available on [Leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/angular-architecture-the-unofficial-guide). The reference application is contained in the _workspace_ folder. It is an Angular Workspace - a monorepo with a single web application project and several library projects.

This book provides the missing guidance to build enterprise-level Angular applications that impress. Simplify your code and focus on what matters by leveraging specific architectural patterns, designs, and principles. This book provides the motivation and actual code and a working application that demonstrates clean architecture for an Angular application.
